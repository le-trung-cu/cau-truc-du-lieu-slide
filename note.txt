What else can DFS do?(#157)
We can augment the DFS algorithm to:
• Compute a graph’s minimum spanning tree.
• Detect and find cycles in a graph.
• Check if a graph is bipartite.
• Find strongly connected components.
• Topologically sort the nodes of a graph.
• Find bridges and articulation points.
• Find augmenting paths in a flow network.
• Generate mazes
