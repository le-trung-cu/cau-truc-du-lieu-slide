# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
#### All Pairs Shortest Path (APSP)

## FW algorithm overview
  - In graph theory, the **Floyd-Warshall (FW)** algorithm is an **All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP)** algorithm. This means it can find the shortest path between all pairs of nodes.
  - The time complexity to run FW is **O(VÂ³)** which ***is ideal for graphs no larger than a couple hundred nodes***.
